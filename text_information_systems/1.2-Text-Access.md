# Text Access Overview
High level strategies to help users get access to text, and how to convert raw big-scale text into smaller chunks that programs and algorithms can use. 

## How can a text information system help users get access to the relevant text data?

* _Push_ vs _Pull_
* _Querying_ vs _Browsing_


In _Pull Mode_, users take the initiative to find the information they need on an ad-hoc basis. In _Push Mode_, systems take initiative. Push mode systems need to know what is needed by the user/system and/or the users need to have a very stable need for information. 



## Pull Mode (search engines)
A typical example is a user entering a search word query and a search engine returning results. The system does not work well when the user doesn't know exactly what they need. In this case, browsing would work better. In _browsing_, the user navigates to the information they need. A browsing system simply maintains structures that the user can browse, and the user can peruse the information space.

## Push Mode (recommendation systems)
Think of things like Youtube recommendations, Spotify recommendations, or the Yelp front page.
