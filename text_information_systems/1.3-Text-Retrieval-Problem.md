# The Text Retrieval Problem
_How do search engines work?_

* What is text retrieval?
* What is database retrieval?
* Document selection vs. document ranking as two strategies for responding to a user's query

Text retrieval is a task where a system responds to a user's query with relevant documents. 

* You have a collection of documents
* User gives a query to the system
* The search engine returns relevant results to the user

This process is sometimes also called information retrieval, although IR is much more broad (audio, video, etc.). In the industry, this can be called "search technology". 

### What is the difference between text retrieval and DB retrieval?

These two tasks are similar in many ways, but also differ. In TR, the data is unstructured. In databases, the data is highly structured. In TR, the query is often ambiguous, as is the meaning of the data. In a DB, both queries and data have well-defined semantics. In TR, the "answer" or response from the system is _relevant documents_, but in a DB, the response is _matching documents_. 

Because TR isn't empirically defined, and the relevance of documents isn't specifically defined, TR can be an ambiguous problem. Different algorithms can have differt results, but there is currently no objective measure of which is inherently _better_. 

## Formal definition of TR problem
* Vocabulary: `V = {w_1, w_2, ..., w_n }` of language (`w` = word)
* Query: `q = `q_1, q_2, ..., q_m
