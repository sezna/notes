If we match the word _campaign_ in a long document with 10,000 words, it is less significant than matching the word _campaign_ in a document with 100 words. We should penalize longer documents, as they naturally are more likely to match any query. We don't want to overpenalize, though. This penalization is called **Document Length Normalization**.

# Pivoted Length Normalizer

A pivoted length normalizer views the average document length as a _pivot point_. If a document has less than or equal to the pivot point, the coefficient on the score (the normalizer) is 1 (or more). If it is longer than the pivot point, we penalize the document and multiply by less than 1.

# Major term weighting heuristics

- TF (Term frequency) weighting and transformation
- IDF (Inverse document frequency) weighting and transformation
- Document length normalization

BM25 and pivoted normalization are the most effective techniques right now.
